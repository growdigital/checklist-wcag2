* [2.2.1 Timing Adjustable (Level A)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#time-limits-required-behaviors)
    * [ ] If a page or application has a time limit, the user is given options to turn off, adjust, or extend that time limit. This is not a requirement for real-time events (e.g., an auction), where the time limit is absolutely required, or if the time limit is longer than 20 hours.
* [2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (Level A)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#time-limits-pause)
    * [ ] Automatically moving, blinking, or scrolling content that lasts longer than 5 seconds can be paused, stopped, or hidden by the user. Moving, blinking, or scrolling can be used to draw attention to or highlight content as long as it lasts less than 5 seconds.

    * [ ] A link is provided to skip navigation and other page elements that are repeated across web pages.
    * [ ] If a page has a proper heading structure, this may be considered a sufficient technique instead of a "Skip to main content" link. Note that navigating by headings is not yet supported in all browsers.
    * [ ] If a page uses frames and the frames are appropriately titled, this is a sufficient technique for bypassing individual frames.
* [2.4.2 Page Titled (Level A)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#navigation-mechanisms-title)

    * [ ] The purpose of each link (or form image button or image map hotspot) can be determined from the link text alone, or from the link text and its context (e.g., surrounding paragraph, list item, table cell, or table headers).
    * [ ] Links (or form image buttons) with the same text that go to different locations are readily distinguishable.
* [2.4.5 Multiple Ways (Level AA)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#navigation-mechanisms-mult-loc)
    * [ ] Multiple ways are available to find other web pages on the site - at least two of: a list of related pages, table of contents, site map, site search, or list of all available web pages.
* [2.4.6 Headings and Labels (Level AA)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#navigation-mechanisms-descriptive)
    * [ ] Page headings and labels for form and interactive controls are informative. Avoid duplicating heading (e.g., "More Details") or label text (e.g., "First Name") unless the structure provides adequate differentiation between them.
* [2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible)
    * [ ] It is visually apparent which page element has the current keyboard focus (i.e., as you tab through the page, you can see where you are).
* [2.4.8 Location (Level AAA)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#navigation-mechanisms-location)
    * [ ] If a web page is part of a sequence of pages or within a complex site structure, an indication of the current page location is provided, for example, through breadcrumbs or specifying the current step in a sequence (e.g., "Step 2 of 5 - Shipping Address").

    * [ ] There are no links (or form image buttons) with the same text that go to different locations.
* [2.4.10 Section Headings (Level AAA)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#navigation-mechanisms-headings)
    * [ ] Beyond providing an overall document structure, individual sections of content are designated using headings, where appropriate.
