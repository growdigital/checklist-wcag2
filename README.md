# WCAG2 Checklist adapted from WebAIM

This is an adaptation of the [WCAG2 checklist by WebAIM](http://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist), in [GitHub Flavored Markdown format](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/).

I wanted a simple and portable [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) checklist that could be used on different projects.

If you're using [GitHub](https://github.com/), it's possible to [add the whole file as an issue](https://github.com/growdigital/checklist-wcag2/issues/1), and the checkboxes will work _from within the issues interface_. How cool is that?
