# WCAG2 Checklist adapted from WebAIM

This is an adaptation of the [WCAG2 checklist by WebAIM](), in [GitHub Flavored Markdown format]().

I wanted a simple and portable [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2]() checklist that could be used on different projects.

If you're using [GitHub](), it's possible to add the whole file as an issue, and the checkboxes will work _from within the issues interface_. How cool is that?
